# DriveExplorer

My first CLI I made using the Google Drive API and Python! Allows you to make a folder and push stuff inside it to your drive straight from the command line!

### Usage

Overall, the usage is super simple with only 2 commands:

- ```dexp setup <directory>```: Log in with google and set up a folder which will be pushed to Drive  
- ```dexp save```: Saves the folder set up with dexp setup and pushes all its contents to Google Drive

(Recommended to not set up many times or at least delete old folders to make it less messy)
